<!-- Read up in detail about D3 selectors: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#d3_select
  1.) D3 selects elements using CSS3; Select a tag ("div"), class (".awesome"), unique identifier ("#foo"_,
  attribute ([color]=red"), or containment ("parent child").
  2.) After selecting elements, you apply 'operators' to the selections in order to do stuff.  Operators
  can get or set attributes, styles, properties, HTML and text content.  Attribute values are specified as
  either constants or functions (if a function, then its evaluated for each element)
  3.) You can also join selections to data (so that operators are working with data), which allows you to do
  enter() and exit() subselections (to add or remove elements in response to changes in data)

          .selectAll("p")  // Selects all paragraphs in the DOM (but since none exist yet), returns an empty selection (think of this as representing paragraphs that will soon exist)
          .data(dataset)  // Counts and parses the data values (there's five values in our array, so everything past this point is executed gives times, one for each value)
          .enter()  // This looks at the current DOM selection, compares to the data being handed to it; if more data values than DOM elements, then enter() creates placeholder elements
          .append("p")  // Takes the empty placeholder selection created by enter() and appends a 'p' element into the DOM
          //.text("New Paragraph");  // Takes the reference to the newly created 'p' element and inserts a text value
          .text(function(d) { // Here we're adding in an 'anonymous' function to the text method, good for accessing individual data values and calculating dynamic properties
            return "I can count up to " + d;  // d needs to be wrapped in an anonymous function or else there's no value there
          });

      // .text(), attr() and other methods take a function as an argument
