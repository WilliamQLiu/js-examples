d3-examples
===========

<h4>Summary</h4>

I'm learning d3.js by breaking things up into smaller examples.  Some of these examples require running a simple server (due to loading data from a csv or json file) so I use the below command and then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ 

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

A few of the interactive examples are available here: http://bl.ocks.org/WilliamQLiu

<h4>Using D3's built-in color schemes</h4>

**Recommended Tutorials**

 - Official D3js website has a list of good examples and tutorials [here][1]
 - Square has a great quick intro to D3 when they onboard [here][2]
 - Christophe Viau has a good one page intro [here][3]
 - Jerome Cukier's "Hello World" in D3, which goes into more detail of setting up your environment available [here][4]
 - Scott Murray (alignedleft) explains things very well.  He's also the author of 'Interactive Data Visualization', which I highly recommend.  Tutorial [here][5]

**Reference API**

 - You're going to see a lot of different d3 functions and wonder what they do.  Use the official API [here][6].
