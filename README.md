js-examples
===========

<h4>Summary</h4>

JavaScript examples using different libraries like d3.js and backbone.js.  Some of these examples require running a simple server (due to loading data from a csv or json file) so I use the below command and then visit my localhost at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

A few of the interactive examples are available here: http://bl.ocks.org/WilliamQLiu
